## Mission
Greetings Space Cadet. Today we will start defining functions. For Levels 1-5, we'll work on a function called jumpAsteroid(). In the curly brackets, {}, write the commands to get Space Dude to the solar panels, then call the function by writing jumpAsteroid().

For Levels 6-10, we'll work on the functions upStair() and downStair(). In the curly brackets, {}, write the commands to get Space Dude to the solar panels, then call the functions by writing upStair(), downStair() or both. 

## Commands

 * `move();` - move forward one space
 * `rotate();` - rotate backwards (counterclockwise 90 degrees)
 * `getPart();` - pick up the space part


## Tips
* You must collect all the parts to move on to the next area.
* Watch out for rocks and other debris.
* Remember the parentheses.
* Only one command per line.


Good luck Space Cadet!
