## Mission
A farmer went to the local market to purchase a chicken, a fox, and a bag of grain. However, to get home, the farmer has to cross a river, but his boat can only hold him and one other object.

If left together, the fox would eat the chicken or the chicken would eat the grain. Your job is to aid the farmer in getting each item across the river without losing any of them!

## Commands

* 'pickUp("item");' - pick up an item to take with you.
* 'crossRiver();' - cross the river
* 'dropOff();' - drop off whichever item you took with you.

##Example

```
pickUp("grain");
crossRiver();
dropOff();
```
