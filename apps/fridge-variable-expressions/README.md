## Mission

We have declared several word variables and made each one into a fridge magnet in which the top line is the variable's name and the bottom line, in green with quotation marks, is its value. You need to give each drawing magnet a value by using the word variables to describe the drawing. 

For instance, if drawing1 showed a bookshelf, and you saw that word1 had a value of "book" and word2 had a value of "shelf", you could label drawing1 with the following code: 

```
var drawing1= word1 + word2;
```

This would retrieve the "book" value from word1 and the "shelf" value from word2 and combine them to form the value "bookshelf", which would then be stored in the drawing1 variable. 

In the early levels, you will only need one word variable for each drawing, but as you move ahead, you may have to use two word variables.
