## Mission

Assign the right **values** to the **variables** on the whiteboard.

## Variables

Variables let you keep track of **values**. You can think of a **variable** as a box with a name that you put a **value** in.

To create a new variable use the word `var` followed by the name of the **variable**. 

```
var animal;
``` 

We just created a **variable**, but nothing is stored in it. It's like an empty box.

To store a value in the **variable** we use `=` followed by the **value** we want to store.

```
var animal = "dog";
```

Now you try!
