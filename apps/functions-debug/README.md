## Mission
Greetings Space Cadet. Today we are going to work on debugging, which is the process of finding and correcting errors in your code. On each level, you will be given some pre-written code that is not quite correct. Your mission is to identify the mistakes in the code and fix them so that Space Dude can recover all his solar panels for his ship. 

##Common Mistakes

 * Spelling- Make sure every function call is spelled correctly, the punctuation is correct, and all parenthesis and bracket openings have a matching closing.
 * Missing Steps- On some of the levels, steps may be missing. Use the lines of code number in the controller to figure out how many lines you need.
 * Incorrect Algorithm- If you steps are in the wrong order, your algorithm is off. Put the steps in the correct order to get the Space Dude where he needs to go. 

## Commands

 * `move();` - move forward one space
 * `rotate();` - rotate backwards (counterclockwise 90 degrees)
 * `getPart();` - pick up the space part


## Tips
* You must collect all the parts to move on to the next area.
* Watch out for rocks and other debris.
* Remember the parentheses.
* Only one command per line.


Good luck Space Cadet!
